## Description
___
During the week I often decide to go out and treat myself at a local bar, pub, or restaurant for some drinks and food. While the wining and dining is often incredible, it can weigh pretty heavily on the wallet after a while. So I can reward myself but also save a dime here or there,  I often attend the same restaurants on basically a rotating schedule to take advantage of all the deals near me. 

HappyHours is a MERN application that allows users to post information about happy hours in the database, as well as update, delete, and retrieve happy hour information in their area easily so they can more easily keep track of great deals. 

Users can also create a list of their favorite happy hours, or search for happy hours happening on a specific day of the week, or even the current day to make finding that 50% off Fireball shot that much easier.

## Getting Started

[Heroku Deployment Link]()

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/c/uvet01Iu/10-chd)

I plan to create a JSON file representing the objects / seed my database with a file of objects representing happy hours and deals nested within.  

Each happy hour will have a designated start time, end time, day/days of the week, and a list of deals for that happy hour. Each deal will be represented by a dealDescription (either a name for an item that has a price (chicken sandwich: $9), or a general string describing the deal such as "half off all mixed drinks", or "girls night!: ladies drink free").

Additionally, each deal will have a day of week variable or a date variable to represent what day it is on. 

In terms of making requests to the database, I aim to give the user the ability to:
  - look at happy hours in the database
  - inspect happy hour information (see deals & times)
  - add new happy hours
  - add new deals to existing happy hours
  - update/remove existing deals in existing happy hours

With respect to the front-end, I want to implement a navigation bar with 'Homepage', 'All Happy Hours', 'Happy Hours By Day/Happy Hours Today', and a 'Favorite Happy Hours'.
